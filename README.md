# Pic 10c FinalProject: The Same Game

## Idea & Introduction

My final project is a classical game called The Same Game. In this game, players need to find groups of two or more blocks with
the same color that are next to each other vertically or horizontally. Once they find such blocks and clicks on them, the 
blocks will be removed from the game board. Then all of the blocks that are above the ones removed will fall down. If an entire
column is removed, all columns to the right will shift to the left. The goal is to remove all the blocks on the play board with
the least number of clicks. The game is over when all the remaining blocks that are adjacent to each other are of different
colors or there are no blocks left. 
This is a classical game that I played so much on my father's phone when I was little, so I am really interested in 
constructing my own Same Game and tring to give it some simple features to make it more playable.

## Process & Struggles

The instruction(https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/game_programming/same_game_part1.html) I followed requires the use of
Visual Studio. Since I am a Mac user and use Xcode for almost all of my assignment, it is the first time that I coded a whole 
project with Visual Studio on a Windows system. I used Visual Studio 2019 with a template of MFC application to create the
game.
With the help of this tutorial:
